# test-PiShrink
Simple script to test additional compression options by @framps for the great [PiShrink](https://github.com/Drewsif/PiShrink ).

Currently it takes no options, I've taken the freedom to copy/paste a few lines from pishrink.sh itself to ensure root. I've hard coded the image's name to a current version of Raspbian. 

## usage
``` sudo test-pishrink ```
